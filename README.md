Hi, I'm Aaron, a 6th year graduate student studying Physics at the University of Oregon.

My thesis work involves utilizing machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning to search for exotic dark particles produced at the Large Hadron Collider.  An example of this method is in the CWoLa repository!
