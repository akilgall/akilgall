Hi, I'm Aaron, a 6th year graduate student studying Physics at the University of Oregon.

My thesis work involves utilizing machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning to search for exotic dark particles produced at the Large Hadron Collider.  An example of this method is in the CWoLa repository!  [CWoLa](https://github.com/akilgall/CWoLa)
While real analysis data can't be released from LHC experiments, an example of this method as applied to toy pseudodata works equally well for demonstrating the power of this method.  

A software project of mine that is currently used in production is called autoTriangulation.  [autoTriangulation](https://www.uahirise.org/tools/at/)  Digital Terrain Models are adjusted relative to fixed laser altimetry to given an absolute calibration of the terrain.  The original software and algorithm was written in MATLAB but was translated to an installable software by a dedicated coder.
